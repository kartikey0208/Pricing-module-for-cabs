Note:
This is the outsketch of how the project is built.
I have used javascript as the primary language.

Step1:
Initialized a nodeJs project in a directory with the main server file named as server.json

Step2:
Installed mongoos/ to enable wrking with mongoDB database
Installed express to get assistance of express App with API functionalities.
Installed jsonwebtoken to use token based authentication

Step3:
Imported the 3 required modules jwt web token, mongoose and express
Intantiated the express app to utilize its functionalities

Step4:
Set up MongoDB schema and model based on the requred specifications
Initialized a MongoDB connection with the help of connection string (hashed for privacy)

Step5:
Set up the authentication middleware based on jwt for protecting access to the API routes

Step6:
Defined routes to respond to API requests.

Step7:
Started the server on say  `{$port}` = `5000`

Now i will dive deep into the step 6 because there the logic lies.
............ to be continued. 


Thanks for reading!
